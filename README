I am trying to add possibility to compile sbcl for android with NDK
toolchain. Since `sbcl` needs to run itself and additional c scripts
in order to compile itself, this requires an android device connected
through adb. An emulator can be used instead.

To compile sbcl you need to run `make-android.sh` script.
You need to specify path to your NDK, for example:
NDK=~/android-sdk/ndk/21.4.7075529 ./make-android.sh

To change make-config.sh parameters you need to edit them manually in
the script at the moment.
To compile for architecture `ARCH` you need to have the following files:
src/runtime/Config.ARCH-android
src/runtime/ARCH-android-os.h

TODO/FIXME
In `make-target-contrib.sh` phase:
* filter contribs to make
* fix 5 seconds timer:
    During compiling sb-posix and sb-bsd-sockets `make-contribs.lisp` tries
    to compile and run C program. But since this is being run on android
    device, which doesn't have a c compiler, it is impossible.
    The current solution is to just print arguments to C compiler
    and compile it from host (filtering such lines with `grep`).
    Then the lisp script waits for 5 seconds and just continues.
    It doesn't check if the program was compiled.
* I have no idea what the Config and .h files should be like
  And which features should be enabled
    Possible android architectures: arm64, arm, x86, x86_64
* in making contribs, add possibility to fetch upstream asdf

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC HINTS

for OpenBSD 6.0 and newer:
  SBCL must be built and run from a filesystem with the "wxallowed"
  mount option, such as /usr/local in the default install.
