For SBCL's README see below

This is a fork that tries to implement symbol links.

To use them you need to build SBCL with symbol-links feature:
./make.sh --with-symbol-links

Symbol links attempt to provide similar functionality to python's
  from math import factorial as f

You can create a link from one symbol to another that is resolved at
read time when SB-EXT:*FOLLOW-SYMBOL-LINKS* is T.

Usage:

(sb-ext:add-symbol-link 'mvb 'multiple-value-bind)
; => T

(mvb (x y) (values 1 2)
  (list x y))
; => (1 2)

(defpackage #:lib
  (:linked-import-from #:alexandria
                       (#:comb #:binomial-coefficient))
  (:export #:comb))

(lib:comb 10 3)
; => 120

(defpackage #:lib2
  (:links (#:*abbrs* #:*abbreviations*)
  (:export #:*abbrs* #:*abbreviations*))

(eq 'lib2:*abbrs* 'lib2:*abbreviations*)
; => T

To remove link:
(setf sb-ext:*follow-symbol-links* nil)
(sb-ext:remove-symbol-link 'mvb)
(setf sb-ext:*follow-symbol-links* t)

or

(sb-ext:symbol-linked-by 'multiple-value-bind)
; => (MVB)
(sb-ext:remove-symbol-link (car *))
; => T

If you'd like more information about using the system, see the man
page, "sbcl.1", or the user manual in the "doc/manual" subdirectory of
the distribution. (The user manual is maintained as Texinfo in the
source distribution; HTML version is available for download, and
"INSTALL" describes how to build the Texinfo version in HTML and PDF.)

The system is a work in progress. See the "TODO" file in the source
distribution for some highlights.

The "BUGS" file lists current known bugs.

before you can post.

The "HACKING" file has more details regarding hacking on and
contributing to SBCL.

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC HINTS

for OpenBSD 6.0 and newer:
  SBCL must be built and run from a filesystem with the "wxallowed"
  mount option, such as /usr/local in the default install.
